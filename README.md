# SystemAnalysisAndDesignCS255

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    DriverPass is a project where the client Luis, wanted a system where people could book driving lessons and view the drivers history all on one page. This page also allowed the user to view current driving laws that would be updated as soon as the DMV posted them yearly. He wanted a all in one system where everything is on one page and for it to be cloud based so it would not go down as much.
  
What did you do particularly well?
    What I did well was set up a solid bases during the beginning of project one. With a strong start, it was easier to continue the following projects. By having the strong business document it was very easy to translate it into different forms and to create diagrams. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    What I would revise would be the presentation. I should have added extra slides, to pull in the customer more. In a real-life experience, I would need more than just those slides to show the customer that the idea was perfect. The user needs to be convinced to love the product I’m presenting.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    How I interpreted the user's needs was by reading the transcript and breaking down each need into certain categories to make it easier to set up documentation. It's important to consider the user's need is because they are paying us to make the product. I started the approach by really seeing what the user wanted out of their product. Seeing design mockups and checking the information, considering all the ideas the user puts down and enhance them.
